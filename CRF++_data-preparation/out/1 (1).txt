Carbonic anhydrases are metalloenzymes, present in most of the living organisms and encoded by seven evolutionarily unrelated gene families: the Î±-. Î²-. Î³-. Î´-. Î¶-. Î·-. and Î¸-CAs CYTOWANIE. The CAs catalyse the basic reaction of reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and proton CYTOWANIE. This reaction is fundamental for biochemical processes in all living organisms CYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE. Invertebrates and lower organisms contain all the seven members of CA gene families and, in some cases, multiple gene families with in the same organism CYTOWANIE. In contrast, vertebrates and mammals contain only Î±-CAs CYTOWANIE. In humans, the CAs regulate a broad range of physiological processes, such as respiration, transport of carbon dioxide/bicarbonate between the lung and metabolising tissues, pH homeostasis, and electrolyte secretion in many tissues and organs CYTOWANIE. There are 15 CA isoforms in humans of which 12 are catalytically active. Three are inactive due to the lack of one or more of the three-histidine residues required for enzymatic activity CYTOWANIE. The human CA isoforms differ from one another in cellular localisation, distribution in organs, levels of expression in tissues and their kinetic properties CYTOWANIE. The human CA isoforms have high sequence and structural similarities, and therefore only subtle differences exist in their active sites CYTOWANIE. In humans, increased expression of CA isoforms is sometimes associated with certain disease conditions CYTOWANIE. The cytosolic hCA I and II proteins have been linked to retinal and cerebral oedema, glaucoma, epilepsy and altitude sickness CYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE. hCA IX, a transmembrane CA isoform, is overexpressed under hypoxic conditions in solid tumours and is involved in the progression of cancer CYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE. Many CA inhibitors have been used for treating various human diseases CYTOWANIE. Even if the inhibitors achieve desirable therapeutic effects, they may cause unacceptable level of toxicity in humans CYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE, most probably due to the off-target effects attributable to the inhibition of CA isoforms that are not involved in the target disease or due to general toxic effects of the chemical CYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE. Therefore, to target particular therapeutic areas with minimal off-target effects, inhibition of specific enzymes is necessary. Thus, there is a particular need to develop inhibitors that are not only selective against the human CAs but are also safe for clinical use CYTOWANIE. Along this line, we have previously developed numerous potent CA inhibitors that are not only effective against specific human Î±-CAs and mycobacterial Î²-CAs, but also show minimal toxicity and are suitable for developing further for clinical use as drugs CYTOWANIE. Recently, we reported sulphonamide and carbamate compounds as hCA IX and mycobacterial Î²-CA inhibitors CYTOWANIE. In addition to the synthesis and inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo evaluation of these compounds, we also tested them for safety and toxicity using 1â5âd post-fertilisation zebrafish larvae. Our studies showed that these inhibitors are safe for further preclinical characterisation using inÂ vivo models CYTOWANIE. In addition, in this study, we were interested in incorporating a nitro-imidazole moiety as a privileged hypoxia sensitising scaffold in the structure of CA inhibitors. The rationale was to investigate a strategy of dual targeting in the context of anticancer agents CYTOWANIE. Previous results have shown the validity of this approach when conjugation of 5-nitroimidazole derivatives to CA inhibitors structures led to new radiosensitiser agents targeting hypoxic tumours CYTOWANIE. To further investigate the effect and the influence of the 5-nitro imidazole moiety and develop new potent and safer inhibitors, we have been continuing our research on new inhibitors in the nitroimidazole series. In the present study, we report the design, synthesis, inÂ vitro CA inhibition, and evaluation of toxicity of novel thiourea derivatives 3 and 4 and a sulphonamide derivative 10 using zebrafish larvae.

MS m/z 236.00 [Mâ+âH]+. An Applied Photophysics stopped-flow instrument was used for assaying the CA-catalyzed CO2 hydration activity CYTOWANIE. Phenol red (at a concentration of 0.2âmM) was used as an indicator, working at the absorbance maximum of 557ânm, with 20âmM Hepes as buffer and 20âmM Na2SO4 , following the initial rates of the CA-catalysed CO2 hydration reaction for a period of 10â100âs. The CO2 concentrations ranged from 1.7 to 17âmM for the determination of the kinetic parameters and inhibition constants. For each inhibitor, at least six traces of the initial 5â10% of the reaction were used for determining the initial velocity. The uncatalysed rates were determined in the same manner and subtracted from the total observed rates. Stock solutions of inhibitor (0.1âmM) were prepared in distilled-deionized water, and dilutions up to 0.01ânM were done thereafter with distilled-deionized water. Inhibitor and enzyme solutions were pre-incubated together for 15âmin at room temperature prior to assay to allow for the formation of the E-I complex. The inhibition constants were obtained by non-linear least-squares methods using PRISM 3 and represent the average from at least three different determinations. CA isoforms were recombinant ones obtained in house as reported earlier. The three compounds 3, 4 and 10 were designed and synthesised with the purpose of developing them as inhibitors of human CAs. Subsequently, all the three compounds were investigated inÂ vitro as inhibitors of human CA I, CA II and CA IX. These compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide to prepare 100âmM stock solutions. Before start of each experiment, the series of dilatation were made from the above stock in an embryonic medium [5.0âmM NaCl, 0.17âmM KCl, 0.33âmM CaCl2, 0.33âmM MgSO4, and 0.1% w/v Methylene Blue ]. Embryos after 1-day post fertilisation were exposed the each of the diluted inhibitor solution. AB strains of wild-type adult zebrafish were maintained at 28.5âÂ°C in an incubator CYTOWANIE. For collecting embryos, 3â5 pairs of male and female fish were set up overnight for breeding CYTOWANIE. The next morning, from the overnight breeding tanks 1â2-h post fertilisation embryos were collected in a sieve and rinsed with embryonic medium [5.0âmM NaCl, 0.17âmM KCl, 0.33âmM CaCl2, 0.33âmM MgSO4, and 0.1% w/v Methylene Blue ] and kept the collected embryos in an incubator at 28.5âÂ°C overnight. The toxicity evaluation studies of the inhibitors were performed using the fish that were 24 hpf. All the zebrafish experiments were performed at the zebrafish core facility, Tampere University, Finland and according to the protocol used in our laboratory CYTOWANIE. Tampere University has an established zebrafish core facility authorisation granted by the National Animal Experiment Board . The experiments using developing zebrafish embryos were performed according to the Provincial Government of Eastern Finland Province Social and Health Department Tampere Regional Service Unit protocol # LSLH-2007â7254/Ym-23. Care was taken to ameliorate suffering by euthanizing the 5 dpf larvae by prolonged immersion in a petri dish containing an overdose of Tricaine before fixing in buffered formaldehyde for histochemical analysis. The LC50 values of the compounds 3, 4 and 10 were determined using 1-dpf embryos exposed to 10â12 different inhibitor concentrations. For each concentration of the inhibitor, we used 30 1dpf larvae CYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE. In each group, the larvae were exposed to different concentrations of the inhibitors that ranged from 12.5âÂµM to 3âmM. The dose response curve was calculated using DRM of the DRC R package CYTOWANIE. The control group was constituted of an equal number of larvae not treated with any chemical and the larvae that were treated with 1% of DMSO. Toxicological evaluation studies were performed in 24-well plates . In each well, we placed 1â2 1-dpf embryos in 1âml of embryonic medium containing a diluted inhibitor. For control groups, 1% DMSO diluted in either embryonic medium or embryonic medium with no chemical compound. A minimum of three sets of experiments were carried out for each inhibitor. The mortality of the larvae was checked every 24âh until 5âd after exposure to the inhibitors. We assessed the effect of inhibitors on the zebrafish larvae after 5âd of exposure to the drugs; we analysed eight observable phenotypic parameters: mortality, hatching, oedema, movement pattern, yolk sack utilisation, heartbeat, body shape and swim bladder development, using a stereo microscope and recorded the observations for each inhibitor treated and control groups. The images of the developing larvae were taken using a Lumar V1.12 fluorescence microscope attached to a camera with a 1.5 lens (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany). The images were analysed with AxioVision software versions 4.7 and 4.8 as described in our standard protocol for assessment of toxicity and safety of the chemical compounds CYTOWANIE. The movement of the zebrafish larvae was tracked from day 4 of exposure to these inhibitors. Similarly, detailed analysis of the swim pattern of the larvae was performed at the end of day 5 after exposure to the inhibitors. For analyses of movement pattern, about 10â15 the zebrafish larvae were placed in a 35âmm Ã 15âmm petri dish containing embryonic medium and the larvae were allowed to settle in the petri dish for 1âmin. The movement of the zebrafish larvae was observed under the microscope for 1âmin. A short video of about 1âmin was taken for each group of larvae that were treated with 125âÂµM concentration. The swim patterns were compared with the control group zebrafish larvae that were not treated with any inhibitor. The histological analyses were done to check the effect of inhibitors on the internal tissues of the larvae that were treated with different concentrations of the inhibitors used in the study and the control group larvae not treated with any inhibitor and the larvae treated with 1% DMSO. After 5âd of exposure to different concentration of the inhibitors, the larvae were washed with phosphate buffered saline immersed in excess amounts of Tricaine to anaesthetize the larvae. The larvae thus prepared were transferred to a 1.5âml microcentrifuge tube and fixed in buffered formaldehyde in PBS for 3âh at room temperature or overnight at 4âÂ°C. After the fixation, the larvae were transferred to 70% ethanol and stored at 4âÂ°C before being embedded in paraffin. The paraffin-embedded samples were sectioned into 5âÂµM thin slices for the histochemical staining. The fixed sections containing samples were deparaffinised in xylene, rehydrated in an alcohol series, and stained with Mayer's Haematoxylin and Eosin Y . After dehydration, the slides were mounted with EntellanÂ® Neu . The slides containing the tissues were examined for morphological changes in the tissues of the larvae exposed to the drugs and photographed using a Nikon Microphot microscope . All the procedures were carried out at room temperature unless stated otherwise. The GraphPad Prism software was used to perform some of the statistical analyses. For statistical analysis of the toxicity parameters, a two-tailed Fisherâs test was used and p values below 0.05 were considered significant. Thiourea derivatives 3 and 4 were prepared starting from the amino analogue of metronidazole 1 which was converted to isothiocyanate 2 using thiophosgene under basic conditions. Reaction either with 4-aniline or 4-phenol in acetonitrile led to the thiourea-derivatives which were then sulphamoylated with sulphamoyl chloride to give, respectively, sulphamide 3 and sulphamate 4 CYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE. Synthesis of thioureas 3 and 4. Reagents and conditions: thiophosgene, NaOH, CHCl3, 0âÂ°C-rt; 4-aniline, CH3CN, rt; NH2SO2Cl, DMA, rt; 4-phenol, CH3CN, rt; NH2SO2Cl, DMA, rt. Compound 10 was prepared in a five-step synthesis starting from metronidazole 5. Mesylation of 5 using methane sulphonyl chloride under basic conditions led to compound 6. Reactions with potassium thioacetate followed by oxidation and treatment with phosgene allowed the formation of sulphonyl chloride 9. Finally, compound 10 was obtained by treatment with a solution ammonia in 1,4-dioxane at room temperature CYTOWANIE. Synthesis of sulphonamide 10. Reagents and conditions: CH3SO2Cl, NEt3, DMAP, DCM, 0âÂ°C â rt; KSAc, DMF, rt; 35% H2O2-CH3COOH, rt; phosgene, cat. dry DMF, dry DCM, rt, NH3 in 1,4 dioxane, benzene, rt. All compounds reported here were assayed as inhibitors of three physiologically relevant CA isoforms, the cytosolic hCA I and II and the transmembrane, tumour-associated hCA IX using the CO2 hydrase assay CYTOWANIE. The clinically employed sulphonamide, acetazolamide , has been used as a standard in these measurements. Inhibition data of compounds 3, 4 and 10 against hCA I, hCA II and hCA IX using a stopped flow CO2 hydrase assay. Average from three different assays, by a stopped flow technique (errors were in the range of Â± 5â10% of the reported values). Compound 10 showed very weak inhibition potency against the abundant cytosolic hCA I with a KIvalue of 6428ânM. The thiourea derivatives 3 and 4 demonstrated sub-micromolar inhibition potency against all CA isoforms. Compound 4 showed the most efficient binding to hCA II (KI= 58.6ânM) with a selectivity ratio of 0.09 for inhibiting hCA II over hCA IX, explained by the influence of the substitution on the benzene ring. Compound 10, the sulphonamide derivative of the sulphamide and sulphamate analogues previously reported and biologically evaluated by our group CYTOWANIE, showed moderate binding efficacy towards hCA II (KI= 199.2ânM) and hCA IX (KI= 147.3ânM). The better binding efficacy of sulphonamide 10 compared to the sulphamide and sulphamate compounds might be explained by higher stability under acidic conditions, i.e. sulphonamideâ>âsulphamideâ>âsulphamate. The lethal effects of all three inhibitor compounds were concentration dependent on the developing zebrafish embryos that were exposed to the inhibitor for 5 d . None of the three inhibitors exhibited any significant mortality in up to 1.5âmM concentration at the end of 5 d of exposure to the inhibitors. Significant mortality of zebrafish larvae emerged at higher concentrations (>2âmM), and the LC50 values at the end of five days were 3âmM for 3 and 2.6âmM for 4 and 10. The half maximal lethal concentrations of the inhibitors were higher compared to any toxicity and safety assessment studies that we have performed earlier CYTOWANIE, suggesting that these compounds can be further developed as inhibitors of human CA I, CA II and CA IX. The LC50 values of the tested CA inhibitor compounds. The LC50 doses for the inhibitors were determined based on the 50% mortality of the larvae at the end of 5 d after the exposure of embryos to different concentrations of inhibitors: compound 3 , 4 and 10 . The LC50 doses were determined after three independent experiments with similar experimental conditions (for each compound Nâ=â90). To assess toxic effects of the inhibitors on the developing zebrafish larvae we analysed eight observable phenotypic parameters namely: hatching, heartbeat, yolk sack utilisation, movement pattern, body shape, swim bladder development, mortality and oedema. The parameters were monitored using a stereo microscope and observations were recorded for each group in comparison with control embryos that were not treated with any of the compounds or treated with 1% DMSO. The images in Figure 2 show the representative larvae exposed to the compounds with concentrations ranging from 75âÂµM to 500âÂµM as compared to the control group larvae. The microscopic examination did not show any of the observable changes in the developing zebrafish embryos at these concentrations and the embryos showed normal phenotypes throughout the period of embryonic development from 2 to 5 dpf. The images of zebrafish larvae in control and inhibitor treated groups. Representative images of 2â5 dpf zebrafish larvae exposed to different concentrations (75, 250 and 500âÎ¼M) of compound 3, 4 and 10. The images of control group and 1% DMSO treated zebrafish larvae show normal development (nâ=â60). We further assessed the toxicity of compounds 3, 4 and 10 compounds in zebrafish larvae across the concentration range 12âÂµMâ3âmM. Figure 3 presents plots of dose-dependent effects of inhibitors on different parameters in treated larvae. The results indicated that none of the inhibitors show significant toxic effects at submillimolar range. Previous toxicity studies on hCA IX and mycobacterial Î²-CA inhibitors showed significant effects on larval mortality and observable phenotypic parameters in the concentration range of 50â300âÂµM CYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE. Therefore, our present results show that 3, 4 and 10 are less toxic in the zebrafish larval model. The effect of compounds 3, 4 and 10 CA inhibitors on the phenotypic parameters of the 5 dpf zebrafish larvae. The plot graphs of different phenotypic abnormalities in hatching, oedema, heartbeat body shape and yolk sac utilisation. For each concentration, nâ=â90. *pâ<â0.05 by two-tailed Fisherâs test. The effects of different concentrations of CA inhibitors on histology were studied by analysing the sections of 5 dpf zebrafish larvae stained with haematoxylin and eosin . The stained sagittal sections of both the inhibitor treated and control larvae were compared by light microscopy. Representative images of zebrafish larval sections are shown in Figure 4. The histological examination revealed no damage to the tissues of the developing zebrafish larvae. Even high concentrations (up to 2âmM) showed no apparent damage to the internal tissues, suggesting that these compounds are safe and can be further developed as CA-specific inhibitors for clinical use. Histochemical analyses of zebrafish larvae. Representative sagittal sections of an untreated zebrafish larva or larva treated with 500âÎ¼M of compound 3 , 4 or 10 . The images presented here are selected from three independent groups of experiments. During development, zebrafish embryos are easily affected by chemical compounds compared to adult zebrafish or other animal or cell models, and therefore are suitable for assessing the subtle toxic effects of the chemicals CYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE. To assess the subtle toxic effects of the inhibitors, the swim pattern of the larvae was examined under the microscope during treatment with the CA inhibitors. The swim pattern analysis showed no abnormal or ataxic movement pattern in the larvae exposed to the inhibitors, up to 2âmM concentration. However, a detailed analysis of the videos at the end of 5âd of inhibitor exposure showed that the larvae of the inhibitor treated groups (125âÂµM) were not as active and tended to remain at the sides of petri dish compared to the control group larvae . The results of the current study reveal that the larvae treated with 3, 4 and 10 become slower while swimming as compared to the swim pattern of the control group larvae. However, swim pattern of larvae treated with 3, 4 and 10 was unlike the larvae treated with nitroimidazole-based inhibitors DTP338 and DTP348, which showed ataxic movement pattern due to neurotoxicity at a concentration as low as 100âÂµM CYTOWANIE. Therefore, these novel thiourea and sulphonamide derivatives can be considered safer for further preclinical characterisation and development as potential drugs. In conclusion, we have designed and synthesised thiourea and sulphonamide derivative compounds with the potential to inhibit human CA I, CA II and CA IX. These proteins which play important pathophysiological roles in human diseases, such as well-known role of CA IX in the progression of solid tumours, and those of CA I and CA II in retinal and cerebral oedema, glaucoma, epilepsy and altitude sickness. The inhibition kinetics of these inhibitors were studied against recombinant human hCA I, hCA II and hCA IX inÂ vitro. Among these compounds, 4 was the most efficient against hCA II (KI 58.6ânM). 10 inhibited human CA IX with KI 147.3ânM. The inhibition properties of these inhibitors against the three hCA isoforms prompted us to test these drugs further for their safety in a zebrafish larval model. The toxicological evaluation indicated that these inhibitors showed no adverse morphological changes nor did they cause abnormal swim pattern at any sub-millimolar concentration. Taken together, the results from both inÂ vitro inhibition studies and toxicological evaluation, we suggest that these inhibitors could be developed into potential drugs targeting hCA I, hCA II and hCA IX with no, or minimal, off-target effects.
