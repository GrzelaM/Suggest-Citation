Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to a chronic inflammation occurring in the gastrointestinal tract with increasing worldwide incidence and prevalence. Two major subtypes of IBD include ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) with distinct injury site and disease types. The exact cause of IBD is not fully understood, but mounting evidences suggest that its pathogenesis is associated with close interactions between genetic, immune, and environmental factors, resulting in impairment of intestinal epithelial barrier and dysregulation of inflammatory cytokine homeostasis. While a couple of molecular targets have been studied for treatment of IBD, only a few target-based approaches are successful and there are no well-validated molecular targets known so far. The best examples of successful anti-IBD treatment would be anti-tumour necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) antibody therapies such as infliximab and adalimumab used in clinics, showing mucosal healing in CDCYTOWANIE. However, some patients do not respond to the drugs, which highlights the necessity of new pharmacological interventions for of IBD. Examples of small molecule inhibitors with good therapeutic outcome are even scarcer. A Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, tofacitinib has recently been included as a therapeutic option in the treatment of UC and possibly of CDCYTOWANIE. Therefore, medical unmet need for small molecule IBD treatment still remains huge. Uncontrolled inflammatory response results from an imbalance between the levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-βCYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE. TNF-α is a master cytokine which induces the production of IL-1β and IL-6 through activation of NF-kB, leading to a vicious cycle of persistent inflammation and deterioration of epithelial functionCYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE. IL-10 and TGF-β which downregulate proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-α and IL-6) production and Th1 immune response, also play a crucial role in maintenance of colon mucosa integrity during inflammationCYTOWANIE. The effects of IL-10 depend on the timing and sources of its secretion. In low to moderate inflammatory condition, IL-10 from dendritic cells or macrophages drives the production of IL-10 by regulatory T cells (Treg), whereas in case of challenging with strong proinflammatory response condition, a large amount of IL-10 is produced from larger populations of cells to minimise pathology during the resolution phase of the challengeCYTOWANIE. During cellular stress or infection, an innate immune response occurs through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) like toll-like receptors (TLR) and NOD-like receptors. NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), one of the most characterised PRRs, forms a multiprotein complex called inflammasome, leading to caspase-1 activation and release of IL-1β and IL-18CYTOWANIE. NLRP3 further triggers pyroptosis, an inflammatory programmed cell death, and thus intestinal barrier damageCYTOWANIE. Abnormal activation of NLRP3 inflammasome has been linked to IBDCYTOWANIE. Based on the findings that inhibition of NLRP3 blocks not only cytokine release but also p’yroptotic cell death, NLRP3 inflammasome is proposed to be a potential target in IBD drug discovery effortsCYTOWANIE. For the last several years, we have conducted a phenotype-based approach to identify small molecule inhibitorsCYTOWANIE. Based on the notion that immune cells such as monocytes infiltrate and adhere to colon epithelium in the presence of TNF-α, we have developed a cell-based screening assay to monitor the cell adhesion phenotype in the presence of compounds. We recently published a couple of papers on the discovery of 6-aminopyridin-3-ols to inhibit IBD in vitro and in vivo (Figure 1). Among the many compounds identified as effective in the previous studies, the analogues having (4-propylphenyl)amino, (6-chloropyridin-3-yl)amino, and (5-phenyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)amino substructures at C(6)-position could be of particular excellence. These three compounds showed >75% inhibitory effect against TNF-α-induced cell adhesion between monocyte and colon epithelial cells at 1 μM concentration. Considering that 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA, mesalazine), an active metabolite of sulfasalazine (SSZ) which is widely used to treat IBD in the clinical field, has only 3.5% inhibitory activity at the same drug concentration (1 μM), the in vitro activity of our three compounds can be quite marvellous. Moreover, in vivo efficacy studies using rats with severe colon inflammation induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) have confirmed that our compounds are certainly effective against IBD. When orally administered at the dose of 1 mg/kg, those compounds showed very good efficacy demonstrated by ameliorating disease parameters such as % of the recovery in colon- and body-weights (up to 79% and 59%, respectively) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) level.2,4,5-Trimethylpyridin-3-ol as anti-IBD scaffold. In this study, we made some changes in the functional group at C(6)-position of the pyridin-3-ol ring and examined how these structural changes affect on efficacy against IBD. We considered five types of functional groups (alkoxy-, ureido-, thioureido-, carbamato-, and sulfonamido-group) to replace 6-amino groups, and synthesised several to a dozen new derivatives for each family (Figure 1). Unless noted otherwise, materials were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Air- or moisture-sensitive reactions were carried out under an inert gas atmosphere. Reaction progress was monitored by thin-layer-chromatography (TLC) using silica gel F254 plates. The products were purified by flash column chromatography using silica gel 60 (70–230 mesh) or by Biotage ‘Isolera One’ system with indicated solvents. Melting points were determined using a Fischer-Jones melting point apparatus and were not corrected. NMR spectra were obtained using Bruker spectrometers 250 MHz or 400 MHz for 1H-NMR and 62.5 MHz or 100 MHz for 13 C-NMR. Chemical shifts (δ) were expressed in ppm using solvent as an internal standard and coupling constant (J) in hertz. Low-resolution mass spectra (LRMS) were obtained using an Advion Expression CMS, and recorded in a positive ion mode with an electrospray (ESI) source. Described below are detailed methods for synthesising the new compounds introduced in this paper. Other compounds were prepared using the synthetic methods we had previously reportedCYTOWANIE. To a suspension of 10% palladium on activated carbon (5 mg) in MeOH (2 ml) was added 7a (20 mg, 0.06 mmol). The mixture was stirred with hydrogen balloon at room temperature for 1 h. After filtration of the reaction mixture through a Celite pad, the filtrate was concentrated. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (CH2Cl2/MeOH = 20/1) to give 8a (9 mg, 98%).

To a solution of 12a (34 mg, 0.11 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (1 ml), was added pentamethylbenzene (50 mg, 0.34 mmol) followed by dropwise addition of boron trichloride (1 M in CH2Cl2, 0.2 ml) at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 15 min then quenched with CHCl3/MeOH solution (9/1, 1.5 ml) and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. After concentration of the reaction mixture, 2 ml of a mixed solvent (CH2Cl2/MeOH = 40/1) was added to the residue and precipitate formed was filtered, washed with CH2Cl2 and collected to give 14a (23.6 mg, 99%).

To a suspension of 10% palladium on activated carbon (5 mg) in a mixed solvent of MeOH (2.5 ml) and CH2Cl2 (2.5 ml) was added 17a (26 mg, 0.08 mmol). The mixture was stirred with hydrogen balloon at room temperature for 1 h. After filtration of the reaction mixture through a Celite pad, the filtrate was concentrated. The residue was dissolved in MeOH and filtered through a membrane filter and concentrated to give 18a (19 mg, 100%). Pale yellow solid; TLC Rf 0.2 (CH2Cl2/MeOH = 20/1); m.p. 142 °C; MS (ESI) m/z 231 [M + H]+; 1H-NMR (DMSO-d6) δ 9.00 (s, 2H), 3.20 (s, 3H), 2.30 (s, 3H), 2.11 (s, 3H), 2.10 (s, 3H); 13 C-NMR (DMSO-d6) δ 147.22, 141.11, 140.84, 134.54, 124.95, 42.20, 19.48, 14.07, 12.69. To a solution of 6-bromo-2,4,5-trimethylpyridin-3-ol (3, 216 mg, 1.0 mmol) of CH3CN (10 ml) were added K2CO3 (207 mg, 1.5 mmol) and iodomethane (0.12 ml, 2.0 mmol). The mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 16 h and then cooled to room temperature. It was diluted with EtOAc and washed with 1 M HCl, water and brine successively. The EtOAc solution was dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (Hexanes/EtOAc = 9/1) to give 19 (154 mg, 67%). Yellow oil; TLC Rf 0.37 (Hexanes/EtOAc = 9/1); MS (ESI) m/z 230 [M + H]+; 1H-NMR (CDCl3) δ 3.67 (s, 3H), 2.44 (s, 3H), 2.30 (s, 3H), 2.24 (s, 3H); 13 C-NMR (CDCl3) δ 152.76, 150.07, 141.29, 137.88, 131.95, 60.33, 18.88, 18.77, 13.50. A solution of 20 (168 mg, 0.51 mmol) in a mixed solvent of THF/MeOH (1/10, 5.5 ml) was cooled to 0 °C. A mixed solution of CH3COCl/MeOH (1/10, 1 ml) was slowly added to the mixture. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 h and then concentrated. The residue was diluted with EtOAc and water. The EtOAc layer separated was extracted with water. To the combined aqueous solution was added 1 M NaOH until the pH of the solution reached 10. After extraction of the mixture with EtOAc, the EtOAc solution was dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (CH2Cl2/MeOH = 30/1) to give 21 (54 mg, 64%). Grey solid; TLC Rf 0.15 (CH2Cl2/MeOH = 20/1); m.p. 84 °C; MS (ESI) m/z 167 [M + H]+; 1H-NMR (DMSO-d6) δ 5.22 (s, 2H), 3.52 (s, 3H), 2.17 (s, 3H), 2.06 (s, 3H), 1.91 (s, 3H); 13 C-NMR (CDCl3) δ 152.25, 146.62, 145.79, 139.72, 113.51, 60.53, 18.45, 13.05, 12.42. RPMI-1640, foetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin/streptomycin and trizol reagent were obtained from Invitrogen Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Trypsin/EDTA was purchased from Clonetics, Inc. (Walkersville, MD, USA). Recombinant human TNF-α was procured from R & D system Inc, (Minneapolis, MN, USA). BCECF/AM (acetoxymethyl ester) was received from Molecular probes (Eugene, Oregon, USA). Antibodies directed against TNF-α, IL-1β, Claudin-2, NLRP3, Claudin-3 and Caspase-1 were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). Antibodies against IL-6 and IL-10 were obtained from Abbiotec (San Diego, CA, USA). E-cadherin, ZO-1, IL-18 and I-κB antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) while NF-κB, TGFβ and phospho-I-κB antibodies were purchased from Cell Signalling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA, USA). HT-29 human colonic epithelial cell line and U937 human pre-monocytic cell line were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). HT-29 cells and U937 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 media containing 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml of penicillin and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in humidifier incubator. Adhesion of monocytes to colon epithelial cell layer was measured by using U937 pre-monocytic cells prelabeled with 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxylfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF/AM, 10 µg/ml) as previously reportedCYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE with slight modification. HT-29 cells (2 × 105 cells/well) cultured in 48-well plates were pre-treated with compounds for 1 h. The prelabeled U937 cells were added on the monolayer of HT-29 cells, and they were treated with TNF-α (10 ng/mL) for 3 h at 37 °C. Non adhering U937 cells were removed by washing thrice with PBS. Cells were lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in Tris (0.1 M), and fluorescence intensity was measured using Fluostar Optima microplate reader (BMG LABTECH GmbH, Germany) at an excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 520 nm, respectively. Sprague-Dawley female rats (seven weeks old) were purchased from Orient Bio Inc (Gyeonggi, South Korea) and were acclimatised to the lab condition for 1 week by giving food and water provided ad libitum. Rats were fasted for 24 h before TNBS injection (0.8 ml of 5% TNBS in 50% ethanol) into the lumen of the colon (8 cm proximal to the anus through the rectum) through an polyethylene catheter fitted onto a 1 ml syringe. Right after TNBS injection, rats were kept in vertical position for 1 min before being returned to the cage. Next day, sulfasalazine (300 mg/kg) or compounds (1 mg/kg) in corn oil was administered for up to 5 days. The doses of the drug were selected based on the previous studiesCYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE. On the sixth day, all the rats were sacrificed and macroscopic observations were evaluated for ulceration and severity of colitis. The colon tissues from 5 to 7 cm proximal to rectum were excised. The colon tissues were stored at −80 °C to examine the protein expression of inflammatory mediators, junctional molecules, and transcription factors. The study protocol of the animal experiment was reviewed and approved beforehand by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Yeungnam University and were performed following the institutional guidelines of the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources (1996), and of Yeungnam University for the care and use of animals (2009). Colon myeloperoxidase (MPO) level was measured by using MPO Rat ELISA kit (HK105-01, Hycult biotechnology, Netherland). Colon tissues were weighed, washed in cold 1× PBS (pH: 7.4), and homogenised in 500 μL of ice-cold lysis buffer (pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris, 10% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 1 µg/mL leupeptide, 28 µg/mL aprotinin) by using a Bead Blaster (Benchmark scientific, Edison, NJ, USA). MPO amount in the supernatant was measured by detecting the absorbance at 450 nm in microplate reader (Spectrostar Nano, BMG LABTECH, Ortenberg, Germany). Total protein from the colon was extracted by using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (150 mM Sodium chloride, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and 50 mM Tris adjusted to pH 8.0) containing 1X proteases and phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, USA). Cytosolic and nuclear proteins were extracted by using manufacturer’s instruction given by NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent kit (#78833, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, USA). Protein concentrations were measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Equal amounts of total proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Life Science, Buckinghamshire, UK) at 200 mA for 1 h. Blocking was done using 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)-Tween 20 (TBS-T) at 20 °C for 1 h. The membranes were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with primary antibody diluted in TBS containing 3% BSA. After incubation, the membranes were washed three times with TBS-T. Next, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at 20 °C with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in TBS. Immunoreactive proteins were visualised using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) and digitally processed using an LAS-4000 mini (Fuji, Japan). The membranes were stripped and re-probed with an actin antibody as a loading control. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM, and were analysed by one way ANOVA followed by the Newman–Keuls comparison method using GraphPad Prism software (version 5.0, San Diego, CA, USA). P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. At first, we were curious about the effect of heteroatom at C(6)-position on activity and replaced nitrogen with oxygen to give 6-alkoxy analogues 8. Synthesis of 8 was conducted via intermediate 5 which has been reported by us (Scheme 1)CYTOWANIE. Briefly, two primary hydroxy groups of pyridoxine·HCl (1) was converted to chlorides using SOCl2 and catalytic amount of DMF. Then, two benzyl chloride groups were reductively removed with Zn and acetic acid under refluxing conditions to give 2,4,5-trimethylpyridin-3-ol (2). The C(6)-position was brominated using 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DBDMH) and the phenolic OH group of 3 was protected as benzyloxy group. Bromide on C(6)-position was replaced with benzophenone imine under Buchwald–Hartwig amination conditions to afford 4. The imine group was then methanolyzed to give the free amino compound (5). The amino group of 5 was converted to hydroxy group via diazonium ion to give 6, which was then treated with various alkyl halides to give alkoxy compounds 7. Lastly, the benzyl protective group was removed by catalytic hydrogenolysis to give 6-alkoxy-2,4,5-trimethylpyridin-3-ol analogues 8. The dihydroxy compound 8a was obtained from the dibenzyloxy compound 7a. A direct approach to obtain 8a from 6 under the standard catalytic hydrogenolysis reaction conditions gave poor yield. Synthesis of alkoxy-analogues 8. Unfortunately, all alkoxy analogues (8a–8f) showed modest activity (29–67%) in our cell adhesion assay (Figure 2). Compound 8a (67% inhibition) and 8f (56% inhibition) showed 2.9- and 2.1-fold higher activity than the corresponding nitrogen counterparts whose inhibition level was 23% and 27%, respectively. Contrarily, compound 8e (29% inhibition) showed 2.5-fold less activity than the corresponding nitrogen counterpart (73% inhibition)CYTOWANIE. The rest of alkoxy analogues with alkyl groups (8 b, 8c, 8d) did not show distinct activity from 6-alkylamino analogues. It seems that nitrogen atom does not necessarily be replaced and might be better to remain on C(6)-position for the better topological polar surface area (tPSA) and calculated partition coefficient (cLogP). By locating nitrogen back to C(6)-position, about 10% of both tPSA and cLogP values can be restored compared to the alkoxy analogues. Therefore, we decided to explore structural diversity with nitrogen atom on the position. Inhibitory activity of the compounds against TNF-α-induced monocyte adhesion to colon epithelial cells. Data are shown as mean ± SEM of at least three independent experiments. *p < 0.05 compared to TNF-α-induced HT-29 cells. Now that we have reported that 6-(substituted)amino-2,4,5-trimethylpyridin-3-ols have high activity against colitis in vitro and in vivo, structural exploration with nitrogen on C(6)-position was designed to install ureido-, thioureido-, carbamato- and sulfonamido-linkage between pyridine ring and R group. Described in Scheme 2 is the general scheme for the preparation of urea and thiourea analogues, 13 and 14. Isocyanates (R − N = C = O)/isothiocyanates (R − N = C = S) were employed for the construction of urea/thiourea moieties. Two key intermediates, 5 and 10, were used for the coupling reactions and the TBDPS-protected intermediate (10) was prepared by the synthetic procedure which we reported beforeCYTOWANIE. In short, compound 10 was prepared from 2,4,5-trimethylpyridin-3-ol (2) by the following sequence; bromination of C(6)-position, protection of − OH with TBDPS group, palladium-catalyzed amination with benzophenone imine, and acidic methanolysis of the imine group. The coupled products with isocyanates and isothiocyanates, 11 and 12, were then transformed the final compounds, 13 and 14, by deprotection of O-benzyl or O-silyl group. For 14a compound with − NH2 group, the precursor, O-benzyl protected compound 12a, was obtained from N-benzoyl thiourea compound 12n by a debenzoylation under basic hydrolysis conditions. Synthesis of ureido- and thioureido-analogues, 13 and 14. For the synthesis of sulfonamido- (16) and carbamato-analogues (18), the key intermediate 5 was treated with either chloroformates or sulphonyl chlorides to give 15 and 17. They were then debenzylated to afford 16 and 18, respectively (Scheme 3). Synthesis of carbamato- and sulfonamido- analogues, 16 and 18. In vitro activity data of the alkoxy- (8), ureido- (13), thioureido- (14), carbamato- (16) and sulfonamido-analogues (18) are listed in Figure 2. As stated above, alkoxy analogues (8) showed activity in a somewhat similar range to the nitrogen counterparts. The best activity (67%) was seen in compound 8a which has no substituent on C(6)-oxygen. Activity of urea (13) and thiourea (14) analogues are also in a similar range. Among the compounds with the same R group, the phenyl group is more active in urea analogue (13 b: 76.3%) than in thiourea analogue (14e: 49.7%). Both p-tolyl and p-methoxyphenyl groups showed similar and low activity both in urea analogues (13d: 20.1%, 13j: 12.6%, respectively) and thiourea analogues (14f: 19.2%, 14 g: 13.3%, respectively). IC50 values of some compounds of high % inhibition were measured to be 0.75 μM (8f), 0.41 μM (13 b), 0.40 μM (14n), 0.32 μM (18d), and 0.23 μM (18c). The order of these values is quite lined with the order of % inhibition measured at the fixed single concentration (1 μM). Next, we tried to investigate the role –OH group on C(3)-position on the activity. The hydroxy group is protected as methoxy group as shown in structure 22 to study if the OH group is essential (Scheme 4). Compounds 22a and 22 b are 3-methoxy analogues of 14j and 14k, respectively, which showed excellent activity in our in vitro assay as shown in Figure 1. The intermediate 3 is methylated with iodomethane and K2CO3 to give 3-methoxy compound 19. Then, benzophenone imine was coupled under Buchwald-Hartwig amination conditions to afford imino compound 20 which in turn was hydrolysed to free amino compound 21. The amino group of 21 was coupled with isothiocyanates to give 22a and 22 b. As shown in Figure 2, unfortunately, 3-methoxy analogues 22a and 22 b showed more than 2-fold less activity than corresponding 3-hydroxy analogues, 14j and 14k, respectively. It might imply that free hydroxyl group at 3-position is essential to the activity by contributing some sort of hydrogen bonding to a binding partner which is responsible for the activity. Further detail of the role of hydroxyl group will be investigated in subsequent studies. Synthesis of 3-methoxy analogues, 22. Next, we evaluated in vivo anti-inflammatory activity using TNBS-induced rat colitis model. Seven pyridin-3-ol compounds, 13 b, 14c, 14j, 14k, 14n, 18c, and 18d, were selected for the in vivo efficacy evaluation along with sulfasalazine (SSZ) as the positive control drug. Colitis was induced by rectal administration of TNBS. Our seven pyridin-3-ol compounds along with SSZ were orally administered once a day for five days starting one-day after administration of TNBS at a dose of 1 mg/kg (for seven pyridin-3-ols) and 300 mg/kg (for SSZ), respectively. After treatment with TNBS, the rats showed signs of colitis, such as body weight decrease, bloody diarrhoea, and sluggish and weak movement. Compared to the sham-operated control group, the body weight of the TNBS-treated rats was significantly reduced and then increased gradually. Colon tissues in the TNBS-treated lesion site showed significant inflammation, as revealed by oedema and adhesion in gross morphology examination and increased wet weight per colon length. As a macroscopic marker to represent a disease phenotype, we measured the recovery level in body- and colon-weights upon drug treatment (Figure 3). Oral administration of rats with compounds, 13 b, 14c, 14j, 14k, 14n, 18c, or 18d (1 mg/kg) significantly restored TNBS-induced body weight loss (Figure 3(A)). The recovery rate by the compounds (1 mg/kg) ranged from 25% to 98.9%, among which compound 14n was the most excellent. The recovery rate of SSZ (300 mg/kg), a positive control, was 48.8%. Colon weight recovery was between 50.3% and 94.9%, which was better than the body weight recovery in most cases of oral administration of the compounds including sulfasalazine (Figure 3(A)). Compound 14n (1 mg/kg) was the most effective in colon weight recovery as in the case of body weight recovery. In addition, the myeloperoxidase (MPO) level in colon tissues, which is directly related to neutrophil infiltration into tissues and serves as a biochemical marker of inflammationCYTOWANIE, was examined. TNBS treatment induced a tremendous increase in MPO activity (Figure 4), and the increase was significantly suppressed by oral administration with compounds (1 mg/kg). The order of the compounds having excellent effects was 14n, 14k, 14c, 14j, 13 b, 18c, and 18d, demonstrating the significant efficacy of the new scaffold. Recovery effects of compounds on TNBS-induced rat colitis, body and colon weights, and MPO activity. Colitis was induced by rectal administration of TNBS, and sham group received vehicle (50% ethanol) in the same route. Compounds (1 mg/kg) and SSZ (300 mg/kg) were given orally 1 day after TNBS treatment. Data represent the mean ± SEM for five rats per group. (A) Body weight was recorded daily from day 0 to day 5, and body weight recovery was calculated based on the last day measurement. Colon wet weight (distal 5–6 cm segment) was measured right after dissection of the colon. #p < 0.05 compared to TNBS-treated group. $p < 0.05 compared to SSZ-treated group. (B) MPO level of colon tissues *p < 0.05 compared to sham-operated control group. #p < 0.05 compared to TNBS-treated group. Inhibitory effects of compounds on expressions of inflammatory cytokines and epithelial junction molecules. Total protein extracts from colon tissues homogenates were used for detecting the protein expression of inflammatory mediators, TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β, and junction molecules, E-cadherin, claudin-2, claudin-3, and ZO-1. The bar graphs represent the mean ± SEM of protein expression quantified in three independent experiments. *p < 0.05, compared with vehicle-treated control group. #p < 0.05, compared with the TNBS-treated group. Although the fundamental molecular targets of the compounds responsible for the phenotype are yet to be investigated, we further examined in this study the inhibitory effects of the compounds on the expression levels of cytokines responsible for the inflammatory response. It will provide more consistency to our mechanism based on the assay against TNF-α-induced cell adhesion. In rat colon tissues, TNBS treatment significantly increased the expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β. The expression level of IL-10 and TGF-β which are known to be secreted by M2 macrophages for termination of inflammation and tissue repairCYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE, were also significantly increased in the inflamed colon tissues (Figure 4(A, B)). In contrast, level of colon epithelial junction molecules, E-cadherin, Claudin-2, Claudin-3 and ZO-1 was significantly reduced by TNBS (Figure 4(A, C)). However, oral administration of compounds, 13b, 14c, 14j, 14k, 14n, 18c, or 18d (1 mg/kg) significantly restored the TNBS-altered protein expressions of junctional molecules. All these changes consistently and strongly support the anti-IBD activity of our compounds. Indeed, the inhibitory effects of compounds, 14c, 14j, 14k, and 14n (1 mg/kg) was much stronger than that of 300 mg/kg SSZ. Next, we also examined whether NLRP3 inflammasome, which plays an important role in IL-1β productionCYTOWANIE, was suppressed by the compounds. TNBS-induced alteration of NLRP3 inflammasome components, NLRP3, pro-caspase-1CYTOWANIE, and cleaved and active caspase-1, were blocked by compounds, 13b, 14c, 14j, 14k, 14n, 18c, or 18d (Figure 5). Similar to the effects of the compounds on cytokine expressions, 14n exerted the strongest effect, which was followed by 14c, 14j, 14k, 13b, 18c, and 18d. Consistent to the result of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, IL-18 level was significantly increased in the colon of TNBS-treated rats, and compounds, 13b, 14c, 14j, 14k, 14n, 18c, and 18d significantly inhibited the TNBS-induced IL-18 expression. NLRP3 inflammasome formation in TNBS-treated rat colon was suppressed by the compounds. Total protein extracts from colon tissue homogenates were used for detection of NLRP3 inflammasome components. The bar graphs represent the mean ± SEM of protein expression quantified in three independent experiments. *p < 0.05, compared with vehicle-treated control group. #p < 0.05, compared with the TNBS-treated group. In the colon of TNBS-treated rats, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), a transcription factor associated with expression of inflammatory cytokines and NLRP3 inflammasome was increased, while cytosolic NF-κB level was decreased in along with inhibitory-κB (I-κB) phosphorylation. However, the compounds significantly suppressed the nuclear translocation of NF-κB (Figure 6). Inhibitory effects of the compounds on the nuclear translocation of NF-κB in along with increase in cytosolic phospho-I-κB. Cytosolic and nuclear proteins extracted from colon tissue homogenates were used for detection of phospho-I-κB, I-κB, and NF-κB. The bar graphs represent the mean ± SEM of protein expression quantified in three independent experiments. *p < 0.05, compared with vehicle-treated control group. #p < 0.05, compared with the TNBS-treated group. TNF-α is a critical player in the pathogenesis of IBD, which is supported by the most efficacious effects of anti-TNF-α biologics in the clinicCYTOWANIE. Based on the notion, we examined anti-IBD activity of various compounds against TNF-α-induced monocyte adhesion to colonic epithelial cells, an in vitro model of initial phase of colitis. In the previous reports, we found that 6-amino-2,4,5-trimethylpyridin-3-ol scaffold was effective against TNF-α-induced cell adhesion between monocyte and colon epithelial cells and against severe inflammation of colon induced by TNBS. Among the 6-aminopyridin-3-ols prepared, compounds A − C showed excellent efficacy in in vivo experimentsCYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE. Structurally speaking, these strong analogues (A − C) contain some sort of sp2-carbon (indicated with arrows) attached to C(6)-nitrogen. In this study, we decided to further explore the chemical space of the substituents on C(6)-position. First, we wondered if nitrogen is essential on C(6)-position for activity and decided to replace it with another heteroatom, oxygen. The resulting alkoxy analogues (8a–8f) showed low to mediocre range activity in our in vitro assay and it seems that nitrogen is quite necessary for the position. Therefore, the next approach we decided to conduct based on the activity of the alkoxy-analogues is to keep nitrogen on C(6)-position and instead introduce carbonyl-like functional groups attached to C(6)-nitrogen as an alteration of sp2-carbon shown in previous papers. This type of analogues include ureido (11), thioureido (12), carbamato (16) and sulfonamido (18) analogues. As a result, many compounds shown in this paper were found to have very strong activity. In vitro, some compounds including thiourea and sulphonamide analogues showed up to 93% inhibition against TNF-α-induced cell adhesion at 1 μM concentration. It is the highest in vitro inhibitory activity measured with pyridin-3-ol analogues we synthesised so far. The order of the compounds having excellent in vitro effects was 14n, 14k, 14c, 14j, 13b, 18c, and 18d. Such in vitro activity of the compounds was consistent with in vivo anti-colitis efficacy (1 mg/kg) on colitis signs and biochemical inflammatory markers, which was much better than SSZ (300 mg/kg). Among high activity compounds, 14n, a thiourea analogue, showed the best in vivo activity represented by macroscopic parameters such as almost complete recovery of colon and body weights (95% and 99%, respectively) in TNBS-induced colitis rat model. Although the exact aetiology of IBD has not yet been clarified, a defective innate immune response seems to play a critical role in the chronic gut inflammationCYTOWANIE. Our current study showing an increase in the expressions of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, referred to as troika of pro-inflammatory cytokines in colon tissues of TNBS-treated rats, was consistent with many previous studies in IBD patients as well as animal models of IBDCYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE. TNBS treatment also significantly increased colonic levels of IL-10 and TGF-β, known as anti-inflammatory cytokines. Although the expression level of IL-10 in experimental colitis is contradictoryCYTOWANIE, IL-10 level may be related to the inflammatory phase, increased at the initial phase and returned to baseline level in the resolution phase of inflammationCYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE. Oral treatments with the compounds significantly suppressed TNBS-induced expressions of IL-10, in addition to TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β in colon tissues, indicating that an anti-colitis activity of the compounds led to the resolution phase of TNBS-induced inflammation. In the case of TGF-β, its production is upregulated by bacteria, viruses, cytokines, and dying cells, in an autocrine or paracrine mannerCYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE. TGF-β suppresses inflammatory responses similar to IL-10, although previous reports on TGF-β expression in IBD have shown contradictory results depending on active or inactive IBDCYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE, TGF-β levels are elevated in inflamed area of gut tissues in IBDCYTOWANIE. Consistently, our current results also showed that TNBS induced TGF-β increase in the colon, and oral administration of the compounds significantly reduced the level of TGF-β with the best effects of 14n, 14k, 14c, and 14j. The innate immune system is activated by the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which recognise pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or endogenous danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) generated during cellular injury or tissue damageCYTOWANIE. PRRs comprise the membrane-bound toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the cytosolic sensory protein complexes such as NOD-like receptors (NLR)CYTOWANIE. NLRP3, an NLR family member, has been highlighted as a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of IBDCYTOWANIE. NLRP3 mediates the assembly and activation of the inflammasome, a multi-protein complex, which recognises cellular stresses and responds to them by activating caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 converts pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms, IL-1β and IL-18, and induces pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell deathCYTOWANIE. In the present study, a significant increase in NLRP3 and caspase-1 in colon tissues by TNBS treatment are correlated to a high-level increase in IL-1β and IL-18. In addition, the correlation between casapase-1 increase and the significant reduction in junction molecules, E-cadherin, claudins, and ZO-1 in TNBS-treated colon implicates TNBS-induced mucosal damage through pyroptosis. Inhibitory effects of compounds, 14n, 14k, 14c, 14j, 13 b, 18c, and 18d on TNBS-induced changes in inflammatory cytokine expression, casapse-1 and junction molecules suggested that anti-colitis effect of the compounds was associated with both anti-inflammatory and mucosal healing activities. In summary, synthetic pyridinols 14n, 14k, 14c, 14j, 13b, 18c, and 18d compounds showed strong inhibitory effects against TNF-α action in vitro and TNBS-induced colitis in vivo. The compound 14n, which showed the highest inhibitory activity against colitis, may be a promising lead compound to develop anti-IBD therapeutics.
