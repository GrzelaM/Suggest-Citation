Protein kinases constitute one of the largest protein families in humans CYTOWANIE. The kinase enzymes in this family catalyse phosphorylation of serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues, which regulate the majority of signal transduction pathways in cell, and thus play an important role in cell growth, metabolism, differentiation and apoptosis consequently. Deregulation of protein kinases is implicated in a number of diseases including cancer, diabetes and inflammation. Targeted inhibition of protein kinases has thereby become an attractive therapeutic strategy in treatment of relevant diseases CYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE. Fibroblast growth-factor receptors form a sub-family of the receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily, which consists of four highly conserved functional members (FGFR 1â4) CYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE. FGFR signalling is initiated by binding of extracellular FGF ligand which leads to receptor dimerisation and cross-phosphorylation of the kinase domains proceed to phosphorylate intracellular substrates such as FRS2, Gab1, PLCÎ³, and STAT1. Subsequent downstream signalling is complex and includes activation of the PI3K-Akt and the Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk pathways. In normal cells, FGFR plays fundamental roles in many physiologic processes, including embryogenesis, tissue homeostasis, tissue repairing, wound healing, and inflammation CYTOWANIE. Therefore, the inhibition of FGFR signalling pathway presents a promising option for cancer therapeutics. In the past few years, different strategies have been pursued to inhibit abnormal FGFR signalling pathways, among them several small-molecule FGFR inhibitors have advanced into clinical trial CYTOWANIE. While the pan-kinase inhibitors (e.g. dovitinib CYTOWANIE, nintedanib CYTOWANIE, and ponatinib CYTOWANIE) which were originally adopted for the treatment of cancers that harbour aberrant FGFR, severe side effects were observed due to inhibition of several off-target kinases such as EGFR, VEGFR, PDGFR, etc. More recently, there has been an increasing interest in developing selective FGFR inhibitors. Several selective FGFR inhibitors bear various scaffolds have been developed into clinical investigation . Structure of representative FGFR inhibitors. In our previous studies, a series of indazole derivatives were discovered as potent FGFR1 inhibitors CYTOWANIE. The most promising compound L1 exhibited good enzymatic inhibition against FGFR1 and modest cellular inhibition . In this study, in order to improve the cellular inhibition, discover novel scaffold and enrich the structure-activity relationship, further work has been putting into modification of indazole scaffold and the hydrophobic substituents. The goal of this compound modification was to increase the ligand-receptor interaction, and improve the physico-chemical property. As a result, we designed the novel FGFR1 inhibitors by the following two strategies: according to the fragment-based drug design strategy, we introduced novel flat hetero aromatic ring which formed key H-bond interaction with hinge region; further optimisation of the original indazole inhibitors via introduced halogen atoms, that were often used to improve permeability through the modulation of modulation of compoundâs lipophilicity and halogen-protein interactions. Herein, with the fragment-based virtual screening strategy, we designed three novel series of FGFR1 inhibitors bearing 1H-1,2,4-triazole, benzothiazole and indazole scaffold (Figure 2). The indazole derivative 9âu stood out as the most potent FGFR1 inhibitor, and it also exhibited good kinase selectivity. Additionally, the docking studies were carried out to investigate the receptor-ligand interaction. Binding model of AZD4547 and NVP-BGJ398 to the FGFR1 kinase domain . The fragment-based virtual screening protocol. The fragment library was derived from kinase hinge region directed library provided by enamine , which contained 11809 fragments. On the basis of the chemical features of FGFR1 inhibitors, these pharmacophore features, hydrogen bond acceptor , hydrogen bond donor , and hydrophobic were defined as a query for pharmacophore screening. The database screening was performed using the Ligand Pharmacophore Mapping protocol in DS 4.0. The fit values were calculated based on the chemical substructures map the location constraints of the pharmacophoric features and their distance deviation from the feature centres. Finally, only the compounds showed good fit values in pharmacophore model could enter the further molecular docking study. Molecular docking of compounds into the three dimensional X-ray structure of FGFR1 was carried out using the surflex-dock module of the Sybyl-x 2.0 software package. The three-dimensional structure of compound was constructed using ChemBio 3âD Ultra software , then it was energetically minimised by using MMFF94 with 5000 iterations and minimum RMS gradient 0.05. The protein was prepared by the Protein preparation wizard of Sybyl-x 2.0. The waters were eliminated from the protein and the polar hydrogen was added. Receptor grids were generated using Receptor Grid Generation. The generated binding site was just the ATP-binding pocket of FGFR1, including several key amino acid residues: Glu562, Ala564. Compound 9d was placed during the molecular docking procedure. Types of interactions of the docked protein with ligand were analysed after the end of molecular docking. The detailed structures and calculation results were shown in Supplementary Table S1. Solvents were distilled under the positive pressure of dry argon before use and dried using standard methods. Chemicals were obtained from local suppliers and were used without further purification. All reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography . NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker 400âMHz instruments, and the chemical shifts were presented in terms of parts per million with TMS as the internal reference. Electron-spray ionisation mass spectra in positive mode data were obtained with a Bruker Esquire 3000+ spectrometer. Flash column chromatography was performed on silica gel (200â300 mesh, Adamas, China). The detail experimental procedures of intermediate 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 are described as previous reference CYTOWANIE . The kinase profiling of 9âu was conducted using Elisa kinase assay and the Eurofins Kinase Profiler Selectivity Testing Service. Elisa kinase assay. The effects of the indicated compounds on the activities of receptor tyrosine kinases were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with purified recombinant proteins. Briefly, 20âÎ¼g/mL poly 4:1 was pre-coated in 96-well plates as a substrate. A 50âÎ¼L aliquot of 10âÎ¼mol/L ATP solution diluted in kinase reaction buffer (50âmmol/L HEPES , 50âmmol/L MgCl2, 0.5âmmol/L MnCl2, 0.2âmmol/L Na3VO4, and 1âmmol/L DTT) was added to each well; 1âÎ¼L of different compounds with indicated concentration diluted in 1% DMSO were then added to each reaction well. DMSO was used as the negative control. The kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of purified tyrosine kinase proteins diluted in 49âÎ¼L of kinase reaction buffer solution. After incubation for 60âmin at 37âÂ°C, the plate was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 . Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (100âÎ¼L; 1:500, diluted in 5âmg/mL BSA T-PBS) was then added. After a 30âmin incubation at 37âÂ°C, the plate was washed three times, and 100âÎ¼L horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2000, diluted in 5âmg/mL BSA T-PBS) was added. The plate was then incubated at 37âÂ°C for 30âmin and washed 3 times. A 100âÎ¼L aliquot of a solution containing 0.03% H2O2 and 2âmg/mL o-phenylenediamine in 0.1âmol/l citrate buffer was added. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50âÎ¼L of 2âmol/l H2SO4 as the colour changed, and the plate was analysed using a multi-well spectrophotometer at 490ânm. The inhibition rate was calculated using the following equation: [1-]âÃâ100%. The IC50 values were calculated from the inhibition curves in two separate experiments. Human gastric cancer cell line SNU-16 was purchased from American Type Culture Collection . All the cell lines were routinely maintained in complete medium according to the suppliersâ recommendations. Cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates. On the day when seeding, the cells were exposed to various concentrations of compounds and further cultured for 72âh at 37âÂ°C. Finally, cell proliferation was determined using Cell Counting Kit or the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide assay. The IC50 values were calculated by concentrationâresponse curve fitting using a SoftMax pro-based four-parameter method. Most selective FGFR1 inhibitors are ATP-competitive inhibitors that bind to the ATP-binding pocket of FGFR. The ATP binding pocket of the FGFR1 consists of five regions3, CYTOWANIE, CYTOWANIE: the adenine region, hydrophobic region I, hydrophobic region II, the nucleotide domain, and the phosphate region. The adenine region is considered as the major binding site in which heterocycle scaffolds are anchored through several H-bonds with a hinge region of the kinase . Meanwhile, the hydrophobic region I and hydrophobic region II are the other two important sites, which plays key factor in binding small molecules by interacting with lipophilic moieties hydrophobically, and forms van der Waals interactions and H-bonds. Accordingly, the inhibitors are commonly involving the following pharmacophore features. The core structure of most inhibitors consists of a flat hetero aromatic ring system that contains at least one H-bond acceptor and H-bond donor, then it can form hydrogen bonds with the key amino acid residues: Glu562 and Ala564. Terminal hydrophobic head often interacts with the hydrophobic region I, which is a phenyl ring with different extra hydrophobic substitutions. Another hydrophobic scaffold directly linked to the flat hetero aromatic ring system which occupies the hydrophobic region II. Herein, we initially pay attention to explore the novel hetero aromatic ring, which was the core structure of FGFR1 inhibitor, formed the key H-bond interaction with hinge region, and connected the hydrophobic region I and II. Furthermore, we superimposed the two FGFR1 crystal structures of 4V05 and 3TTO, which were complexed with AZD4547 CYTOWANIE and NVP-BGJ 398 CYTOWANIE, respectively. The results revealed that AZD4547 and NVP-BGJ 398 were similar in their binding mode with the target were similarly, when there was a significant spatial distance constraint between the pharmacophore features. The spatial distance of the hydrophobic head and the heterocycle ring is between 5.9âÃ and 6.5âÃ (Figure 2and Figure S2). Therefore, the FGFR1 inhibitors might contain the corresponding pharmacophore features, and these pharmacophore features were also consisted to a space distance constraint. The fragment library was derived from kinase hinge region directed library, which contained 11809 scaffolds. Subsequently, with the built pharmacophore model and molecular docking, seven hit fragments were obtained through serval round filtration . One of them was indazole scaffold, which was proved to be an efficiency FGFR1 inhibitor scaffold CYTOWANIE, which indicated the accuracy of virtual screening protocol. Then, in view of the difficulties in synthesis, only 1H-1,2,4-triazole, benzothiazole and indazole scaffold were selected for further modification (Figure 2). The novel 1H-1,2,4-triazole and benzothiazole scaffolds were selected for the study of FGFR1 inhibitors research. Furthermore, we also continued to optimise the original indazole derivatives, improve the physicochemical property and enrich the structure-activity relationship of indazole derivatives. Finally, we synthesised several indazole derivatives through introduced halogen substituents at various positions. As a result, with the fragment-based virtual screening strategy, novel derivatives bearing 1H-1,2,4-triazole, benzothiazole and indazole scaffold were designed, synthesised and evaluated. The preparation of target compounds 9a-t, 12a-d and 18a-c was described in Schemes 1â3. Compounds 9a-t were synthesised from starting material 4-fluorobenzoate and 4-bromo-2-fluorobenzonitrile through seven steps. The nucleophilic substitution reactions of 4-fluorobenzoate with various piperazines afforded the methyl ester 2 intermediate, which then could hydrolysis to carboxylic acid 3. Subsequently, the carboxylic acid 3 was condensed with HATU to provide the activated ester reagent 4. Meanwhile, the intermediate 5 could be condensed by 4-bromo-2-fluorobenzonitrile 1 with hydrazine. Then nitrogen atom at the 1-position of 1H-indazol-3-amine scaffold 5 was protected by BOC group. The key intermediate 8 was obtained by condensation of 4 and 7 in the presence of NaH. Treatment of the intermediate 8 with various substituted-phenylboronic acid under Suzuki coupling condition CYTOWANIE of PdCl2 and Cs2CO3 in refluxing dioxane/water gave target compounds. According to the similar synthetic route, compounds 12a-d were synthesised from the starting material 6-bromobenzothiazol-2-amine through two steps. Synthesis of indazole derivatives. Reagents and conditions: K2CO3, DMSO, 120âÂ°C, 85â90%; NaOH, MeOH, H2O, 80âÂ°C, 93â96%; HATU, K2CO3, DMF, rt, 62â70%; hydrazine hydrate, n-butanol, 120âÂ°C, 86%; Boc2O, DMAP, THF, 89%; NaH, THF, 60âÂ°C, 52â61%; TFA, CH2Cl2, 0âÂ°C, 70%; R-B2, Cs2CO3, PdCl2, dioxane, 120âÂ°C, 30â48%. Synthesis of benzothiazole derivatives. Reagents and conditions: 4, NaH, THF, 60âÂ°C, 51â62%; R-B2, Cs2CO3, PdCl2, dioxane, 120âÂ°C, 47â53%. Synthesis of 1H-1,2,4-triazole derivatives. Reagents and conditions: propanedioic acid, pyridine, piperidine, 105âÂ°C, 77â82%; Pd/C, H2, EtOH, 88â93%; SO2Cl2, reflux; amino guanidine hydrochloride, 140âÂ°C, 49â53%; 4, NaH, THF, 60âÂ°C, 54â62%; TFA, CH2Cl2, 0âÂ°C, 70%. The synthesis of the other 1H-1,2,4-triazole derivatives was shown in Scheme 3. The starting material substituted-benzaldehyde was condensed with propanedioic acid in the presence of pyridine and piperidine at 105âÂ°C via Aldol condensation, which the intermediate 14 was obtained. After hydrogenation of 14 released the corresponding aliphatic acid 15, which was connected with the amino guanidine hydrochloride giving triazole scaffold 16 in 49.1% yield. Then nitrogen atom at the 1-position of the 1H-1,2,4-triazole heterocycle 16 was protected by BOC group. The target compounds 18a-c were prepared in similar way by following condensation and Suzuki-coupling procedures. Initially, we designed and synthesised the indazole , benzothiazole and 1H-1,2,4-triazole derivatives, with the goal of analysing the effects of different scaffolds on biological activity . All these compounds were evaluated against FGFR1 enzyme and SNU-16 cell line. The results indicated that when the heterocycle was substituted by a 1H-1,2,4-triazole scaffold, it would result in almost no enzyme inhibitory activities and cell anti-proliferative activities. Furthermore, the corresponding benzothiazole derivatives 12a-d were also revealed poor inhibitory activity against FGFR1 enzyme (IC50 >1000ânM), thus led to slight reduction cellular anti-proliferative activities. Structures and activities of various derivatives 9a-d, 12a-d, and 18a-c. The IC50 values are shown as the average values from two separate experiments. SNU-16 is FGFR2-amplified cell type. âNAâ means IC50 > 5âÎ¼M. Fortunately, compound 9a with an indazole scaffold exhibited good FGFR1 enzyme inhibitory activity (IC50 = 30.6ânM) and modest cellular inhibition (IC50 = 1195.7ânM). While the 3,5-dimethoxy phenyl substituent was replaced with the 3-methoxy phenyl group, the enzyme inhibition of 9âb was relatively lower than 9a. However it was more potent in cellular assay (9a vs 9âb). Besides, co-crystal structure analysis revealed that the R1 substituent is at the solvent region of the target protein, which might be helpful to improve membrane permeability and enhance cellular potencies. Then the other two derivatives 9c and 9d with N-methyl piperazine and N-ethyl piperazine substituent at the R1 position, respectively, were synthesised and evaluated. As a result, the 9d demonstrated the best enzyme inhibitory (IC50 = 15.0ânM) and cellular anti-proliferative activities (IC50 = 785.8ânM). The above results demonstrated that the heterocycle could significantly affect the enzyme and cell growth inhibitory activity. The hydrophobic group I located in the hydrophobic cavity of the active site and formed strong hydrophobic interaction with the target. To increase the enzyme inhibitory activity, we initially optimised the hydrophobic group I . It was indicated that 3-methoxy phenyl (9d, IC50 = 15.0ânM) was substituted by the 3-ethoxy phenyl (9e, IC50 = 13.2ânM), 3-isopropoxy phenyl (9f, IC50 = 9.8ânM) caused increase of activity. On the contrary, the compound 9âh with 3-s-butoxy phenyl exhibited low enzymatic inhibitory activity (IC50 > 1000ânM). Meanwhile, the compound with 3-COOMe-phenyl (9âh, IC50 = 77.7ânM), 3,5-dichloro-phenyl (9k, IC50 = 67.2ânM), 2,5-dichloro-phenyl (9âl, IC50 = 50.6ânM), 2,3-dichloro-phenyl (9âm, IC50 = 44.8ânM), 2,6-methyl-phenyl (9q, IC50 = 41.7ânM), shown moderate FGFR1 inhibitory activity. On the other hand, compounds containing a substituent either the electron-withdrawing or electron-donating group at para-position, were significant decreasing their activities (9d vs 9i; 9k, 9âl and 9âm vs 9n; 9âm vs 9p). Furthermore, the additional halogen atoms on phenyl might be helpful to improve physicochemical properties and enhance the cell anti-proliferative activities. Thus, the compound 9o (IC50 = 5.5ânM) containing a fluorine atom at the para-position of phenyl showed better inhibitory activity than their counterparts lack of these atoms (9d, IC50 = 15.0ânM). Structures and activities of indazole derivatives 9eât. The IC50 values are shown as the average values from two separate experiments. SNU-16 is FGFR2-amplified cell type. âNAâ means IC50 > 5âÎ¼M. The active compounds 9e, 9f, 9âh, 9k, 9âl, 9âm, 9o and 9q were also selected for further evaluation of their cellular potencies . Although, the FGFR1 enzyme inhibitory activities of compound 9âh and 9j were higher than that of 9d, while the cell anti-proliferative activities were similar. Besides, compound 9o bearing a fluorine atom at meta-position of phenyl resulted in 1.4-fold enhancement of the cellular inhibition , which exhibited the best enzyme and cellular inhibitory activity of these indazole compounds 9e-t. As the above reported, R1 group located at the solvent region of the target protein, which might be help to improve membrane permeability and enhance cell anti-proliferative activities. Another six compounds 9âu-z were designed, prepared and evaluated for their biological activities . The results of inhibition of FGFR1 assay revealed that (2S, 6âR)-2,6-dimethyl-1-phenylpiperazine (9v, IC50 = 13.2ânM), and N-methyl-4-phenylpiperazine (9ây, IC50 = 10.2ânM) led to slight reduction potency comparing to N-ethyl-4-phenylpiperazine (9o, IC50 = 5.5ânM), while introducing of a 1-benzyl-4-methylpiperazine group (9x, IC50 > 1000ânM) demonstrated poor inhibitory activity against FGFR1 enzyme. Meanwhile, the FGFR1 inhibitory activities of compounds 9âu, 9w and 9z were enhanced, and the lead compound 9âu was 1.5-fold enhancement. More importantly, the cellular potencies were improved by introducing various R1 group (9âu, 9v and 9w vs 9o), and among them 9âu exhibited the good FGFR1 inhibitory activity and cell anti-proliferative activity. Therefore, we selected 9âu as the lead compound for further pharmacological research. Structures and activities of indazole derivatives 9âuâz. The IC50 values are shown as the average values from two separate experiments. SNU-16 is FGFR2-amplified cell type. âNAâ means IC50 > 5âÎ¼M. To identify the kinase selectivity of the lead compound 9âu, the pharmacological experiment was first evaluated by testing it against our in-house panel of tyrosine kinases. The results were summarised in Table 4, 9âu effectively inhibited the potent activities of FGFR1-3 with IC50 values of 3.3ânM, 5.2ânM and 12.2ânM, respectively. However, 9âu exhibited low enzymatic inhibitory activity (IC50 > 1000ânM), which indicated that 9âu is a selective FGFR1-3 inhibitor. The reason was that the sequence of FGFR1-3 was very similar, while the sequence of FGFR4 was quite different. Therefore, the binding mode of FGFR1-3 inhibitor was different from FGFR4 inhibitor, and the pharmacophore of FGFR4 inhibitor usually contained an acrylamide group . Furthermore, IC50 values for most of kinases were greater than 1âÎ¼M except for Flt-1, RET and c-Src, which were inhibited at sub-micromolar concentrations of the compound. As a result, compound 9âu exhibited good kinase selectivity. Selectivity of 9âu in a panel of kinases. The docking simulation was performed to elucidate the binding mode of the various scaffold derivatives 9d, 12a and 18âb, the potent indazole inhibitor 9e and 9f, the inactive inhibitor 9âg with FGFR1. These compounds were docked into the ATP-binding pocket of FGFR1 . As a result, the core indazole ring of compound 9d was entered the adenine region by forming the essential H-bond interaction with hinge residue Glu562 and Ala564 , while the N-H of indazole scaffold formed H-bond with Glu562, and the nitrogen atom of indazole scaffold and N-H of amide formed another two hydrogen bond with Ala564 (Figure 3). Meanwhile, the 3-methoxy phenyl group occupied the hydrophobic area I, and hydrophobic interact with the lipophilic residue Leu547, Val561 and Phe 642. However, while the hetero aromatic rings were converted to 1H-1,2,4-triazole or benzothiazole, there was weakly H-bond interaction with Ala564, and no H-bond interaction with Glu562 (Figure 3). Besides, the hydrophobic group I was deviated from hydrophobic pocket. The above docking results might explain why the triazole and benzothiazole derivatives lost their biological activities (12a docking score: 6.380, 18âb docking score: 6.588). The docking mode of compound 9d , 12a , and 18âb . Superposed docking poses of 9e , 9f , and 9âg . Additionally, the methoxy group of 9d was inserted into a small hydrophobic cavity of the hydrophobic area I. While this cavity could contain a certain size of lipophilic group, thus the ethyloxy substituent of 9e and the iso-propyxoy substituent of 9f were more appropriate to this hydrophobic cavity, meanwhile 9e and 9f shown more potent FGFR1 inhibitory activity than 9d. However, the cavity could not accommodate large volume groups, including the sec-butoxy group (9âg docking score: 5.668, IC50 > 1000ânM). The molecular simulation results may further confirm the inhibitory potency of 9e and 9f against FGFR1, and the 9âg was inactive (Figure 3). In summary, we designed three novel series of FGFR1 inhibitors bearing indazole, benzothiazole, and 1H-1,2,4-triazole scaffold via fragment-based virtual screening. Interestingly, 33 new compounds were synthesised and evaluated for their inhibitory activity against FGFR1. Initially, the indazole derivative 9d was identified as a promising FGFR1 inhibitor, with the good enzymatic inhibition (IC50 = 15.0ânM) and modest anti-proliferative activity (IC50 = 785.8ânM). Then, the hit 9d was further optimised, through two rounds of optimisation, the compound 9âu stood out as the most potent FGFR1 inhibitors with the best enzyme inhibitory (IC50 = 3.3ânM) and cellular activity (IC50 = 468.2ânM). Moreover, 9âu also exhibited good kinase selectivity. Meanwhile, the docking study was performed to investigate the putative interaction mechanism with the FGFR1 target. Further studies on the structural optimisation and biological evaluation of 9âu are currently underway in our laboratory. Our study would provide a basis for discovering novel FGFR1 inhibitors.
